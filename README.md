I will be making this repo and the Assistant sexier over time, meanwhile you can do the following to try it on your machine locally

1. Download the parent folder
2. Run the setup.bat which will download all the required files nearly **9GB**
3. Then run the LAUNCHER.bat which will show you green and red buttons, green to initiate you can close everything on your screen after this) and red to terminate the AI.
4. Saying "Jarvis" activates the AI for input, then whatever you save, it records, once it detects "over" then only it starts processing and then give output.

What is not working/I expect from this in future:
1. I should be able to interrupt while it is answering (tried but not working)
2. It should toggle system settings like brightness volume, opening apps etc
3. It should be uncensored, raw, can talk and learn about anything I want it to.
4. Sexier GUI for more JARVIS like feel
and many more...
